OOP Python Battle Ship Game With Multiple Players


OOP battle ship game. Designed by Blue Lightning.
Mainly to play around and try to learn python by writeing a project I wrote in C++ into python.
And cause I wanted to challenge myself everything is set up so you can change the set-up/number of players size of board.
Potentially will take me awhile cause I'm not working on it consistently.
