OOP Python Battle Ship Game With Multiple Players


OOP battle ship game. Designed by Blue Lightning.
Mainly to play around and try to learn python by writing a project I wrote in C++ into python.
And cause I wanted to challenge myself everything is set up so you can change the set-up/number of players size of board.
Potentially will take me awhile cause I'm not working on it consistently.

Also at any given moment it may not be functional due to working on it in a environment where I can't test it
